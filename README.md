# Mood_Bottle
## Description
- This product is made for people who need a place to express their personal feelings. Its main function is recording: we made 2 bottles (Good mood bottle and bad mood bottle), users can click the good bottle and leave some words on that page and vice versa. The system would keep their essays in the  Mood Review. The users can review the essays whenever they want via clicking the  Mood Review. 
- We also made some additional features：Friends Bottle, Weather,Divination and Mood Analysis. Users can bind their friends’ accounts to the Friends Bottle, and then they can see each other's essays. The Weather  would show the weather  on the home page. If users want to see their daily fortune，they can click the Divination.
